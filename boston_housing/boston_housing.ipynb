    "Welcome to the first project of the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree! In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and you will need to implement additional functionality to successfully complete this project. You will not need to modify the included code beyond what is requested. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a 'TODO' statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to implementing code, there will be questions that you must answer which relate to the project and your implementation. Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the following text boxes that begin with **'Answer:'**. Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

    "## Getting Started\n",
    "In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home â€” in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n",
    "- 16 data points have an `'MEDV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.\n",
    "- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.\n",
    "- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MEDV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.\n",
    "- The feature `'MEDV'` has been **multiplicatively scaled** to account for 35 years of market inflation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to load the Boston housing dataset, along with a few of the necessary Python libraries required for this project. You will know the dataset loaded successfully if the size of the dataset is reported."

    "* **`'RM'`** The average number of rooms most certainly will be positvely correlated with the price. Meaning that with a higher number of average rooms the home prices in this neighborhood will (in average) be worth more (Regression coefficient will have a postive value - ignoring a possible marginal relationship with other variables). _Justification: More rooms will in average use more space and space is expensive. More rooms are also meaning a higher standard which leads to higher prices. (This might be questionable, because the area would be more meaninful for this interpretation. Though given a dataset from 1978 i do not to expect the data to have lots of houses with exceptionally big rooms.)_\n",
    "* **`'LSTAT'`**: I expect the percentage of working poors in the neighborhood to have a negative correlation with the average housing prices in the area (Regression coefficient will be negative - ignoring potential marginal relationships). _Justification: People tend to value the social status of a home and a neighborhood. Therefore the prices for homes in an area with more working poors will decrease._\n",
    "* **`'PTRATIO'`**: The ration of students to teachers I expect to have a negative correlation with the average housing prices in the neighborhood (Regression coefficient will be negative - ignoring potential marginal relationships). _Justification: Statistics are showing that students which are receiving more attention will have better grades. Therefore I assume, that schools with less students per teacher to have a better performance. This might lead to better education which could lead to higher living standards in a neighborhood (in average). Another justification is in the other direction: Neighborhood with more money (and more upper class people) will spend more for education and therefore have less students per teacher._"

A model with an R<sup>2</sup> of 0 is no better than a model that always predicts the *mean* of the target variable, whereas a model with an R<sup>2</sup> of 1 perfectly predicts the target variable. Any value between 0 and 1 indicates what percentage of the target variable, using this model, can be explained by the **features**. _A model can be given a negative R<sup>2</sup> as well, which indicates that the model is **arbitrarily worse** than one that always predicts the mean of the target variable._\n",

There are various thresholds for the interpretation of the `R^2` score, but a coefficient of determination of 0.923 certainly is a strong result and means, that the predictor variable has a strong effect on the dependent variable. (Usually everything above a value of 0.7 is considered a moderate to strong correlation) Therefore I think, the model has succesfully captured the variation of the target variable. Though because we do not have stated our hypothesis (explanation of the correlation) in advance and we not even know what the variables are, this result has to be treated very carefully. The regressor and the regressand might not have a meaningful, explainable correlation. And to be shure, we are talking about correlation and not casuality. \n",

    "An optimal model is not necessarily a robust model. Sometimes, a model is either too complex or too simple to sufficiently generalize to new data. Sometimes, a model could use a learning algorithm that is not appropriate for the structure of the data given. Other times, the data itself could be too noisy or contain too few samples to allow a model to adequately capture the target variable â€” i.e., the model is underfitted. \n",
